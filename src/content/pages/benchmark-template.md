![Chart showing relative strength of models on Rakuda benchmark]($STRENGTH_CHART$)

**Rakuda** is a ranking of Japanese Large Language Models based on how well they answer a set of open-ended questions in Japanese about Japanese topics. We hope that Rakuda can help stimulate the development of open-source models that perform well in Japanese, in the spirit of English-language leaderboards like Huggingface's [human_eval_llm](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/human_eval_llm_leaderboard). For a detailed explanation of how Rakuda works, please check out the [accompanying blog post](/blog/rakuda), and for the full code implementation check out the project on [github](https://github.com/yuzu-ai/japanese-llm-ranking).

In brief, we ask the AI Assistants in the ranking to answer a set of [40 open-ended questions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuzuai/rakuda-questions). We then show pairs of these answers to GPT-4 and ask it to choose which model gave a better answer. Based on GPT-4's preferences, we estimate the underlying Bradley-Terry strength of each model in a Bayesian fashion. Bradley-Terry strengths are optimal versions of Elo scores.

Please contact us if you have any suggestions or requests for models that you'd like us to add to this ranking!
